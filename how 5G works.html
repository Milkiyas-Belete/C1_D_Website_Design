    <h2>How does 5G work</h2>

<span style="color:rgb(170, 5, 5)">
-5G architectures will be software-defined platforms</span>, in which networking functionality is managed through software rather than hardware.<br> Advancements in virtualization, cloud-based technologies, and IT and business process automation enable 5G architecture to be agile and flexible and to provide anytime, anywhere user access.
5G can run on any frequency, leading to three very different kinds of 5G experiences—low, middle, and high.
<h3>Low-band 5G</h3> operates in frequencies below 2GHz. These are the oldest cellular and TV frequencies. <br>They go great distances, but there aren't very wide channels available, and many of those channels are being used for 4G. <br>So low-band 5G is slow. It acts and feels like 4G, for now.
<h3>Mid-band 5G</h3>is in the 2–10GHz range. That covers most current cellular and Wi-Fi frequencies, as well as frequencies slightly above those. <br>These networks have decent range from their towers, often about half a mile.
<h3>High-band 5G</h3>, or millimeter-wave, is the really new stuff. So far, this is mostly airwaves in the 20-100GHz range.<br> They're very short range; tests have shown about 800-foot distances from towers.<br> But there's vast amounts of unused spectrum up there, which means very fast speeds using up to 800MHz at a time.
